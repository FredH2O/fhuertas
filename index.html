                        <p>At Deep Blue Aquatic's we believe that fish deserve the right environment to live a happy and
                            healthy life. Goldfish bowls do not provide this and therefore we do not sell them. Goldfish
                            can live up to twenty years and grow to even 4 times their size when living in the right
                            conditions. Goldfish and other species need to live in a tank with a filter and ornaments to
                            hide in or investigate as they are intelligent! They also need plants to help keep the
                            oxygen levels in the water high. Fish extract oxygen from the water around them, and if
                            there is no filter to filter out waste, then there is no oxygen. Fish don't want to live in
                            their own toilet. Be kind, be safe, and buy a proper tank and filter for your new pet.
                            Ask any of the staff for help in choosing the right fish and tank for you!</p>

                                Isolate sick fish. Add antibiotics to the water and use antibiotic-medicated food.
                                Maintain
                                good water quality. Quarantine any fish with signs of the disease.</p>

                            <p>No, our fish are trained to track you down ðŸ¤£ joking. Our fish are placed in plastic bags
                                with water and oxygen before being put in boxes.
                                Tropical
                                fish are then put in a suitable insulated box with a heat pack if necessary.</p>
                        </details>

                            <summary>I won a goldfish at the fair. What tank do I need?</summary>
                            <p> You'll need a three-foot
                                tank, a filter, gravel, decoration, tap safe, filter bacteria and
                                food
                                for that young goldfish, and ideally, the tank should be set up and mature before adding
                                any
                                fish. If you know anyone with a mature coldwater tank to house it until you are ready,
                                give
                                it to them, or a goldfish pond.

                                A small plastic bowl won't cut it unfortunately and the fish will die within a few days
                                of
                                being added. Not everyone agrees with goldfish being given out as prizes, so think
                                carefully
                                before doing so.</p>

                            <summary>Can I mix goldfish with tropical fish?</summary>
                            <p> Goldfish can take tropical temperatures no problem, but they will grow large and could
                                be
                                attacked by wild type tropical fish species like loaches and sharks. It's possible but
                                it's
                                a compromise and if your tank gets problems and you take expert advice, they'll tell you
                                to
                                remove the goldfish. Goldfish require more oxygen in warm water too.
